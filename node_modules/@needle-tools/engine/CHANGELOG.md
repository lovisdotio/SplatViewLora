## [2.65.0-pre.1] - 2023-03-10
- Fix: issue where `<needle-engine>` element was not yet in the DOM when queried by exporter codegen which caused the paths to not be assigned and the engine to not load

## [2.65.0-pre] - 2023-03-09
- Add: runtime checks for recursive loading to prevent it from breaking
- Change: internal duplicate active state on `Object3D` has been removed, instead `visible` is used. This was previously a workaround for the `Renderer` setting the visible state when being enabled or disabled but this has been changed in a previous version and it now only sets a flag in the object's Layers instead (which allows for a single object in the hierarchy to not being rendered by setting `Renderer.enabled = false` while objects in the child hierarchy stay visible) 
- Change: `<needle-engine>` src attribute can now also take an array of glbs to load. This simplifies codegen done by exporters and also prevents errors due to bundler optimizations as well as being easier to understand. Runtime changes of the `src` attribute (especially when using arrays of files) have not been tested for this release. Networking for `src` changes has been removed in this release. 
- Change: move engine into src subfolder. All paths to explicit script files are now `@needle-tools/engine/src/...`
- Change: poster screenshot will be taken after 200ms now
- Change: canvas default set to false for castShadow and receiveShadow
- Change: Remote skybox should not set `scene.background` when in XR with pass through device (e.g. when using Quest Pro AR or AR on mobile)
- Fix: issue where ColorAdjustments Volume effect was applied with `active` set to false
- Fix: `Light` not being enabled again after disabling the component once

## [2.64.0-pre] - 2023-03-07
- Add: `PlayableDirector` now correctly applies timescale
- Add: `PlayableDirector.speed` property allowing to play the timeline at different speeds or even reverse (reversed audio playback is not supported at the moment)
- Add: `Physics.enabled` property for disabling physics updates. This also prevents any collider shapes to be created
- Add: `this.gameObject.transform` property to ease getting started for devs coming from Unity. This property is merely a forward to `this.gameObject` and shouldnt really be used. The property description contains information and a [link to the docs](https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/docs/transform) with further information.
- Fix: instanced materials using progressive loading are now correctly updated
- Fix: Timeline animation tracks now disable the `Animator`. This fixes cases where two animations were played at the same time. When the PlayableDirector is paused or stopped the animator state is reset
- Fix: License styles leaking into website
- Fix: Timeline audio not stopping correctly at end of timeline when set to hold
- Change: improve instancing updates, instanced objects now auto update detect matrix changes. This includes improvements of instancing when used with `Animation` components
- Change: set particle system layers to `IgnoreRaycast` to not receive wrong click events on batched particle meshes
- Change: Timeline audio is now loaded on evaluation. Only clips in a range of 1 second to the current time are loading. To manually trigger preload of audio you can invoke `loadAudio` with a time range on audio tracks of a timeline
