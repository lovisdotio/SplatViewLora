/**
 * This module contains the networking schemes used by Needle Engine.
 * They are used to define the structure of the data that is sent over the network.
 * Networking can use plain text or flatbuffers for serialization.
 * Flatbuffers are more efficient and faster than plain text, but require more setup work.
 *
 * Some core components, like SyncedCamera or SyncedTransform, thus use Flatbuffers for networking to reduce latency and bandwidth.
 *
 * Schemes are compiled with [Flatbuffers 2.0](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
