/**
 * **Decorate a field to be automatically networked synced**
 * *Primitive* values are all automatically synced (like string, boolean, number).
 * For *arrays or objects* make sure to re-assign them (e.g. `this.mySyncField = this.mySyncField`) to trigger an update
 *
 * @param onFieldChanged name of a callback function that will be called when the field is changed.
 * You can also pass in a function like so: syncField(myClass.prototype.myFunctionToBeCalled)
 * Note: if you return `false` from this function you'll prevent the field from being synced with other clients
 * (for example a networked color is sent as a number and may be converted to a color in the receiver again)
 * Parameters: (newValue, previousValue)
