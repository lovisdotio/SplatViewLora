/**
 * <needle-engine> web component. See {@link NeedleEngineAttributes} attributes for supported attributes
 * The needle engine web component creates and manages a needle engine context which is responsible for rendering a 3D scene using threejs.
 * The needle engine context is created when the src attribute is set and disposed when the needle engine is removed from the document (you can prevent this by setting the keep-alive attribute to true).
 * The needle engine context is accessible via the context property on the needle engine element (e.g. document.querySelector("needle-engine").context).
 * @link https://engine.needle.tools/docs/reference/needle-engine-attributes
 *
 * @example
 * <needle-engine src="https://example.com/scene.glb"></needle-engine>
 * @example
 * <needle-engine src="https://example.com/scene.glb" camera-controls="false"></needle-engine>
