 * The ISceneEventListener is called by the {@link SceneSwitcher} when a scene is loaded or unloaded.
 * It must be added to the root object of your scene (that is being loaded) or on the same object as the SceneSwitcher
 * It can be used to e.g. smooth the transition between scenes or to load additional content when a scene is loaded.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ISceneEventListener } from "@needle-tools/engine";
 *
 * // Add this component to the root object of a scene loaded by a SceneSwitcher or to the same object as the SceneSwitcher
 * export class MySceneListener implements ISceneEventListener {
 *   async sceneOpened(sceneSwitcher: SceneSwitcher) {
 *    console.log("Scene opened", sceneSwitcher.currentlyLoadedScene?.url);
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *

    sceneClosing(): Promise<void>;
}
/** The SceneSwitcher can be used to dynamically load and unload extra content
 * Available scenes are defined in the `scenes` array.
 * Loaded scenes will be added to the SceneSwitcher's GameObject as a child and removed when another scene is loaded by the same SceneSwitcher.
 * Live Examples
 * - [Multi Scenes Sample](https://engine.needle.tools/samples/multi-scenes-dynamic-loading) (source code available)
 * - [Needle Website](https://needle.tools)

 *
 * ### Interfaces
 * Use the {@link ISceneEventListener} interface to listen to scene open and closing events with the ability to modify transitions and stall the scene loading process.
 *
 * ### Events
 * - `loadscene-start`: Called when a scene starts loading
 * - `loadscene-finished`: Called when a scene finished loading
 * - `progress`: Called when a scene is loading and the progress changes
 * - `scene-opened`: Called when a scene is loaded and added to the SceneSwitcher's GameObject
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * sceneSwitcher.addEventListener("loadscene-start", (e) => {
 *    console.log("Loading scene", e.detail.scene.url);
 * });
 * sceneSwitcher.addEventListener("loadscene-finished", (e) => {
 *   console.log("Finished loading scene", e.detail.scene.url);
 * });
 * sceneSwitcher.addEventListener("progress", (e) => {
 *  console.log("Loading progress", e.loaded, e.total);
 * });
 * sceneSwitcher.addEventListener("scene-opened", (e) => {
 * console.log("Scene opened", e.detail.scene.url);
 * });
 * ```
