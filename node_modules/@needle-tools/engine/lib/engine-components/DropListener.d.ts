 * - **object-added** - dispatched when a new object is added to the scene
 * - **file-dropped** - dispatched when a file is dropped into the scene
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { DropListener, DropListenerEvents } from "@needle-tools/engine";
 *
 * const dropListener = new DropListener();
 *
 * gameObject.addComponent(dropListener);
 * dropListener.on(DropListenerEvents.FileDropped, (evt) => {
