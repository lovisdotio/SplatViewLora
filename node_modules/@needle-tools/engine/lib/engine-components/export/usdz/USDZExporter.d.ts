 * Exports the current scene or a specific object as USDZ file and opens it in QuickLook on iOS/iPadOS/visionOS.
 * The USDZ file is generated using the Needle Engine ThreeUSDZExporter.
 * The exporter supports various extensions to add custom behaviors and interactions to the USDZ file.
 * The exporter can automatically collect Animations and AudioSources and export them as playing at the start.
 * The exporter can also add a custom QuickLook overlay with a call to action button and custom branding.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const usdz = new USDZExporter();
 * usdz.objectToExport = myObject;
 * usdz.autoExportAnimations = true;
 * usdz.autoExportAudioSources = true;
 * usdz.exportAsync();
 * ```
